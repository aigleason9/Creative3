# Bookstore

Regarding the functionality of the remove button on the cart page, please note that in this case it is intentional that it removes all of that book from the cart.

## Main changes from Creative Project 2:
- All pages now loaded through Vue and use vue to more efficiently create page design
- Removed entertainment page with API calls (to fit better on theme)
- Updated Catalogue page to include more books
- Added search by author and title, browse by genre options, and cart
- Books available in catalogue (and visible in other pages) now grouped in data
