# Creative3

I did use images of book covers that I could not have found on creative commons. However, I reviewed Fair Use and feel that this use does not constitute a problem as it is for educational purposes, I am not profiting financially from this use, and I (or my roommates or my immediate family) own copies of the books pictured on this site.
