# Bookstore

The images of book covers  were not taken from Creative Commons as I could not find them there. I reviewed Fair Use myself--because this is for educational purposes, I have no plans of financial gain, and I (or my immediate family) own copies of all the books shown here, I feel that this is an acceptable use of book cover images.

Also, regarding the functionality of the remove button on the cart page, please note that in this case it is intentional that it removes all of that book from the cart.

## Main changes from Creative Project 2:
- All pages now loaded through Vue and use vue to more efficiently create page design
- Removed entertainment page with API calls (to fit better on theme)
- Updated Catalogue page to include more books
- Added search by author and title, browse by genre options, and cart
- Books available in catalogue (and visible in other pages) now grouped in data
